OK, great. You can start looking into dumps now. I’ll have a more thorough write-up for you later, but for now — the basic idea is that we want to look at a dump and see what’s happening there in terms of waits. The WCT API won’t help because it only works on a live process. The CLRMD BlockingObject API works, but it doesn’t cover everything (e.g. Win32 mechanisms). 
 
The way we’re going to go is extracting parameters from the stack. You already have code that extracts wait information from 32-bit stacks by recognizing WaitForSingleObject and WaitForMultipleObjects. We will start with that. What you will need though is a way to get the wait object information from the handle you get from the stack. Here’s a starting point for parsing dump files: http://moyix.blogspot.co.il/2008/05/parsing-windows-minidumps.html — take a look at this script and the MSDN documentation for the various MINIDUMP_* structures. The information we’ll be interested in is in the MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA_STREAM directory, described here as well: http://www.debuginfo.com/examples/handledump.html 
 
Try to start from there and see how it goes.
